Description: Hawkes Process and Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Simulation 
    with different algorithms: 
    modified thinning, 
    closed form of inverse cumulative intensity function and 
    a proposed algorithm that combines numerical inversion, order statistics 
    and transformation (time rescaling).
